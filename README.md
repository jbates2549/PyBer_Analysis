# PyBer_Analysis Using Python in Jupyter Notebook
# 

## Overview of Project
  This project provides statistical analysis ride share date based on city type.  In this analyis we determine the effects on city types to the fares generated for ride sharing services.  We used Python in Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data and we charted the results by city type.
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to determine the factors that city type play in determining ride share rates and overall revenues.
## Analysis 
In this analysis, we took data sets containing city data and ride share data and combined the data into a single dataframe.  From the combined dataframe we extracted data for each city type; Rural, Suburban and Urban. The extracted data included ride counts, driver counts, fare totals and averages of each.  Then we created a summary dataframe to summarize this data.  We then refactored the data using the pivot and refactoring functions to analyze the data for each city type by date range.  We charted the 


### Conclusions from Outcomes Based Fundraising Goals

From the analysis we can see that urban city types generated the most revenue followed by suburban types.  Rural city types generated the least amount of revenue.  These revenue amounts were generated despite the fact that the average fares per ride and per driver are much lower for Urban drivers that for Rural drivers.  The high revenue for Urban drivers is generated by the much higher volume of rides as compared to Suburban and Rural drivers.
